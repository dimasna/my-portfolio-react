# My Portfolio React

> a few weeks ago, I bought some courses about react in [Arkademy](https://www.arkademy.com/learn/courses/react-dan-graphql) and [DesignCode.io](https://designcode.io/react-for-designers). and start implement that course with creating this app using my own design. I'm using gatsby bulma starter for this app you can found [here](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/gatsby-bulma-quickstart) and make my own component from scratch.
